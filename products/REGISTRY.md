```

- **💡 Opportunity**: Idea in `strategy/opportunities/` — needs analysis

## Adding a Product

Products are created automatically by the [Product Creation Pipeline](../.github/workflows/product-creation.yml).

To create a new product:
1. An opportunity in `strategy/opportunities/` gets approved by @fratei
2. The pipeline creates a repo from the [product template](https://github.com/fratei/creativware-product-template)
3. The product is registered here automatically
4. Agents begin working on the new product
